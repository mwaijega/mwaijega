I see patterns where others see problems,  
My mind solves puzzles that make others stop.  
I turn coffee into amazing programs,  
Making computers do what seems impossible.  

When experts say "it can't be done," I smile,  
Then build solutions they didn't imagine.  
From simple apps to complex systems,  
who I'm, WHO I'M indeed.
